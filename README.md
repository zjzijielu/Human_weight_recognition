# human_weight_recognition2
Human weight recognition using VGG16 network

Zijie Lu, Luca Conti

This human weight recognition program will recognize people's weight by "overweight", "normal weight" and "underweight.
Wed use 1200 for each class, among which 1000 are in the training set, and the other 200 are in the validation set.

human_weight_recognition_2.py file won't work because I didn't upload the pictures, of which th total size is over 2GB. \n if you are interested, please contact me at zl1298@nyu.edu for the dataset.
